# 🔍 Multiple Disease Prediction

This repository hosts the project **Multiple Disease Prediction** 🩺, a web application that enables users to predict 🧮 the likelihood of specific diseases 🦠 based on input data. The app is deployed at: [🌐 Multiple Disease Prediction App](https://predictiondisease.streamlit.app/).

---

## ✨ Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean 🧼 and interactive 🤝 web application built with Streamlit.
- **Disease Prediction Models**: Models trained to predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes 🍬, heart disease ❤️, and others.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Input 🖊️ patient data and get instant ⚡ results.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python**: Core programming language.
- **🤖 Machine Learning**: Predictive models built using libraries like Scikit-learn.
- **🖥️ Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web application.
- **📊 Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **🔢 NumPy**: Numerical computations.

## 📥 Installation and Usage

### 🌀 Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/singhsourav0/Multiple_Disease_Prediction.git
cd Multiple_Disease_Prediction
```

### 📦 Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have Python installed 🐍. Then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Run Locally

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **Data Input**: Users provide key health metrics 📈 (e.g., glucose level 🍭, blood pressure 💉).
2. **Prediction**: The app runs the input through trained machine learning models 🤖.
3. **Result**: Displays the likelihood of the disease 📊.
